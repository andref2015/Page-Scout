# Page Scout
Page Scout is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly and easily summarize any selected text on a webpage. Simply highlight the text you want to summarize and right click to select "Page Scout" from the context menu. A window will then open with a summary of the text in the form of a concise list of bullet points.

But fear not, you need not be a tech pro to set this script up. No coding skills are required — I didn't even know how to code myself when I asked ChatGPT to write the code for me. That's right, I was too lazy to learn how to code, so I just asked a computer to do it for me. 

While the script itself is free, you will have to pay (small) fees to OpenAI for using GPT-3.
